# Sales & Finance Analytics for AtliQ Hardware
This project is an advanced-level data analytics project focused on Sales and Finance analytics for AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in hardware and peripheral sales.
The goal was to dive deep into sales data to generate key reports that would help the company improve its financial decision-making processes and monitor critical business KPIs.

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware works with several large clients such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart, and its sales data is scattered across multiple sources and is highly unorganized. 
In this project, I worked with over half a million sales records, leveraging ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to organize and structure the data. 
The reports produced provide actionable insights into the company’s sales performance, customer behavior, and financial health. 
These insights empower AtliQ Hardware's management to make better strategic decisions and monitor their financial goals.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project was to analyze the sales and financial data for AtliQ Hardware and create several insightful reports that would help the company understand 
their performance and make data-driven decisions. 

The specific goals were to:

- Clean and organize the sales data using ETL processes.
- Create performance reports for sales, customers, and markets.
- Identify key performance trends in terms of sales growth, product performance, and profitability.
- Help the company improve its net sales, gross margin, and overall financial health.
  
## Data Preparation
The project involved cleaning and transforming the data using ETL processes:

**Extract:-** Extracted raw data from various sources like CSV and Excel files.

**Transform:-** Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating it in a structured format.

**Load:-** Loaded the transformed data into Excel where further analysis could take place.
I used Power Pivot to model the data and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures. 
These techniques allowed me to build interactive reports that can be used for decision-making.

## Reports Generation
Here are the key reports I created to help AtliQ Hardware monitor and improve its business performance:

1. *Customer Performance Report :-*
This report shows the Net Sales for different customers in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.
It also includes the % Performance Growth (2021 vs 2020). This report can be filtered to show the performance of individual customers by country, region, or division.
The insights from this report help AtliQ understand the sales behavior of key customers and identify growth opportunities.

3. *Market Performance vs Targets Report :-*
This report compares Sales Targets versus Actual Performance for different countries in 2021.
I calculated the difference between the actual sales and targets, along with the % of target achievement. The report can be filtered by  region, or division, providing insights
into which markets met, exceeded, or missed their sales targets.

5. *Top 10 Products Report :-*
In this report, I identified the top 10 products based on the percentage increase in net sales from 2020 to 2021.
This helps the company understand which products are performing well and which ones are driving revenue growth.

6. *Division-wise Sales Report :-*
This report breaks down the sales performance by division, showcasing net sales for 2020 and 2021 along with the growth percentage.
It provides AtliQ with a clear picture of which divisions are driving growth and where there might be room for improvement.

7. *Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products Report :-*
This report highlights the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on the quantity sold.
This report helps identify high-demand products as well as those that are underperforming.

9. *Top 5 Countries Report :-*
Here, I created a report showing the Top 5 countries in terms of net sales in 2021.
This helps AtliQ understand which regions are the biggest contributors to their revenue and can drive market-specific strategies for growth.

11. *Fiscal Year and Monthly P/L Reports :-* These reports provide insights into the Gross Margin for different markets, customers, divisions, and regions across fiscal years and months.
This allows the company to understand its profitability trends and make data-backed decisions for cost management and investment.

13. *% Gross Margins by Quarters (sub_zone) :-* I also created a report showcasing the % Gross Margins across different sub-zones by quarters. 
This helps to monitor financial health over time and across various regions or sub-zones.

## Key Insights and Learnings
Throughout this project, I learned the value of data-driven decision-making and gained practical experience in working with large datasets.

Here are the key insights:

- *Business Opportunity Discovery:* I learned how business analysts uncover opportunities by analyzing historical data and identifying key trends.

- *Project Priority Matrix:* I created a project priority matrix that helps project managers prioritize their tasks based on business impact and effort.
This is crucial for improving project management efficiency.

- *Importance of ETL Processes:* I recognized the significant role ETL processes play in preparing data for analysis.
Proper data cleaning, transformation, and structuring ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

- *Pivot Tables & Power Pivot:* I enhanced my understanding of Pivot Tables for summarization and Power Pivot for advanced data modeling.
These tools enable efficient summarization, sorting, and analysis, making it easier to generate reports and dashboards.

- *Conditional Formatting:* The use of Conditional Formatting was vital in highlighting key data points, such as identifying high/low values, growth trends, and deviations from targets.
This enhances the clarity of reports.

- *Real-Life Data Projects:* Working on real-life data projects like this one helped me better understand how to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations and deliver impactful business insights.
